1. Convert 129 JPG Files to 129 TXT Files

# Convert 129 JPG files to 129 TXT files

import easyocr
import os

# Set up the OCR reader from EasyOCR
reader = easyocr.Reader(['en'])

# Folder where all the prescription images are stored
input_folder = "/storage/pictures/prescription"
# Folder to save the text files after extraction
output_folder = "/storage/pictures/output_txt"

# Create output folder if it doesn't exist
if not os.path.exists(output_folder):
    os.makedirs(output_folder)

# Get all the .jpg image files from the folder
image_files = [f for f in os.listdir(input_folder) if f.endswith('.jpg')]

# Loop through each image and process it
for image_file in image_files:
    image_path = os.path.join(input_folder, image_file)
    
    # Use EasyOCR to extract text from the image
    result = reader.readtext(image_path)

    # Join all text extracted and save it into a .txt file
    text = "\n".join([item[1] for item in result])
    output_file = os.path.join(output_folder, image_file.replace(".jpg", ".txt"))
    
    # Write the extracted text into the output .txt file
    with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
        file.write(text)

    print(f"Processed and saved: {image_file}")



2. Cleaning and Organizing the 129 TXT Files

# Clean and organize the 129 TXT files

import os

# Path where the raw .txt files are saved
txt_folder = "/storage/pictures/output_txt"
# Folder to store the cleaned text files
output_folder = "/storage/pictures/cleaned_txt"

# Make sure the cleaned folder exists
if not os.path.exists(output_folder):
    os.makedirs(output_folder)

# List all .txt files in the folder
txt_files = [f for f in os.listdir(txt_folder) if f.endswith('.txt')]

# Loop through the files and clean them up
for txt_file in txt_files:
    file_path = os.path.join(txt_folder, txt_file)
    
    # Open the text file and read its content
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        text = file.read()

    # Clean up the text: remove extra spaces and unwanted characters
    cleaned_text = ' '.join(text.split())  # Removes excess whitespace between words

    # Add custom logic for further cleaning or organizing, if necessary
    # For now, I just remove unnecessary spaces between text

    # Save the cleaned text to the new output folder
    cleaned_file_path = os.path.join(output_folder, txt_file)
    with open(cleaned_file_path, 'w') as cleaned_file:
        cleaned_file.write(cleaned_text)

    print(f"Cleaned and saved: {txt_file}")



3. Convert 129 TXT Files into 1 CSV File


# Convert 129 TXT files into 1 CSV file

import os
import pandas as pd

# Path where the cleaned .txt files are stored
txt_folder = "/storage/pictures/cleaned_txt"
# Path where the final CSV will be saved
output_csv = "/storage/pictures/final_output.csv"

# List all cleaned .txt files
txt_files = [f for f in os.listdir(txt_folder) if f.endswith('.txt')]

# Initialize an empty list to store all the structured data
structured_data = []

# Loop through each cleaned .txt file and extract the data
for txt_file in txt_files:
    file_path = os.path.join(txt_folder, txt_file)
    
    # Open the .txt file and read the cleaned text
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        text = file.read()

    # Clean the text further if necessary, for now just space cleaning
    cleaned_text = ' '.join(text.split())  # Removes extra spaces

    # Store the file name and its cleaned text as one record
    structured_data.append([txt_file, cleaned_text])

# Convert the list of structured data into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(structured_data, columns=["File Name", "Cleaned Text"])

# Save the DataFrame as a .csv file
df.to_csv(output_csv, index=False)

print(f"All files converted into CSV: {output_csv}")
